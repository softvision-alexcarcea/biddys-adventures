How to...
=========

It's quite simple, really: just follow the intuitive setup available in `package.json` and `npm run start` (or, even easier, simply `npm start`). This should open up a barebones HTTP server (typically, [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)) that _should_ load up the `index.html` page (availabe in `public/` folder) auto-magically. (If it doesn't, simply append `index.html` to the URL of the newly opened tab). That's it, that's all you need to know. The rest is pure CSS / HTML.
